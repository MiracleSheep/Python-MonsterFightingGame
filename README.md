# Python-MonsterFightingGame
This is my first game in python, simply to practice. it is a procedurally generated monster fighting game

### What this game does
1. Makes the player kill as many monsters as they choose to beat the round.
2. Gives the player random health and attacks, and attack names.
2. Created a monster, with random names, attacks, attack names, ect.
3. Fight as many of these as you designate to win the game.

> Note: This is my very first game in python, and it is not something I am trying really hard to perfect, so the game itself won't have many features.
