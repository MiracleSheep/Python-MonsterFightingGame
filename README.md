# Python-MonsterFightingGame
This is my first game in python, simply to practice. it is a procedurally generated monster fighting game

### What this game does
1. Makes the player kill as many monsters as they choose to beat the round.
2. Gives the player random health and attacks.
2. Created a monster, with random names, attacks, attack names, ect.
3. Fight as many of these as you designate to win the game.
4. Similar to rock paper scissors but in a different format.

> Note: This is my very first program in python, and it is not something I am trying really hard to perfect, so the game itself won't have many features.
